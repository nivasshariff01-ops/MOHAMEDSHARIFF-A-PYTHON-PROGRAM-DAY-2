ANSWER

name = input().strip()   
m1 = int(input())       
m2 = int(input())
m3 = int(input())
m4 = int(input())
m5 = int(input())

# Calculate total and average
total = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5
average = total / 5

# Print outputs
print("Name of the Student:" + name)
print("Total marks:" + str(total))
print("Average marks:" + str(average))
