second input consist of integer
Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format

execute the Arithmetic calculation values.
Sample Input 0

45
7
Sample Output 0

Addition=52
Subtraction=38
Multiplication=315
Division=6
Modulo=3

ANSWER

a = int(input())   # First integer
b = int(input())   # Second integer

# Performing arithmetic operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a // b     # Integer division
modulo = a % b

# Printing results
print("Addition=" + str(addition))
print("Subtraction=" + str(subtraction))
print("Multiplication=" + str(multiplication))
print("Division=" + str(division))
print("Modulo=" + str(modulo))
